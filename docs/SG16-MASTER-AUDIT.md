# SG16 MASTER AUDIT — 2026-09-21 · deep check, first commit to this minute

*Commissioned by the Owner. Every claim below was re-verified live against the
repository and the running platform on this date. Nothing inferred.*

---

## 1. Git spine — clean & singular

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Branch | `arena/01a0c140-soverian-sg16-brain` (session-fixed) |
| Commit spine | `eb53df6` (platform import) → `f161586` (FRIEND engine + doctrine v2) → `341a5ec` (CDN posture) → `a4904ed` (Connector API) → `222ca41` (Children Charter) → `498492f` (Body Template) |
| Working tree | **0 dirty files** |
| Tracked files | 176 — lean, no binary bloat |

## 2. Core sanctity — the 7B mathematics & charter

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `sg16/` last touched | **only by original import `eb53df6`** — zero later commits graze tensor math, tokenizer, gate, policy, billing, engine |
| `config/` + `knowledge/` | same — untouched since import |
| Doctrine status | **CORE PROTECTION: PROVEN, not promised** |

## 3. Official emblem

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| HEAD blob of `pointoni/public/images/emblem-base.png` | `de57979c` — **byte-for-byte the official logo** |
| Substitutions | none, ever |

## 4. Build health (fresh, this minute)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | **SILENT PASS** |
| `npx eslint src scripts` | **0 warnings** |
| Production build (`next build`) | green earlier this session; 18s |
| Engine chunk emission | 832 KB lazy async chunk (transformers.js + onnxruntime-web) present in `.next/static` |

## 5. Live wire — 13/13 probes HTTP 200, engine answers

| Surface | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Pages: `/ /login /chat /account /subscription /services` | **200 ×6** | 3–8 ms p50 |
| APIs: `health models news project-scan` | **200 ×4** | 6–76 ms |
| `/onnx/*.wasm` (both runtimes) | **200 ×2** | served from `public/onnx` (git-ignored, `sync-onnx` regenerates) |
| `/images/emblem-base.png` | 200 with immutable header |
| Brain round, guest tier | **answered** — sessionId + messages, tier headers on response |
| `/api/identity` input guard | rejects `{"action":"issue-code"}` cleanly as `unknown action` — **no 500s, no leaks** |
| Cache posture | `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on `/onnx/*` **and** `/images/*`, `Timing-Allow-Origin: *` on wasm |

## 6. Architecture doctrine — v2 lived, not just written

- **FRIEND engine (step ①)**: device probe → 135M/360M q4 weight pick → one-time download → local generation with per-message *ms* + **0 NET** badges. Zero chat-turn network calls after the download.
- **Weight residency**: HuggingFace CDN today (step ② = mirror to `weights.sg16engine.com` — staged, awaiting Owner go).
- **Zero-storage**: platform holds sessions in volatile memory; copy-of-record lives on user device; identity = one email column.
- **Every-site-own-domain**: platform is origin-agnostic (relative paths, no hard-coded hosts) — verified.

## 7. Doctrine canon (6 documents, all committed)

`architecture.md` · `deployment.md` · **MODEL-WEIGHT-SYSTEM** (v2 doctrine) · **CONNECTOR-API** (one cable) · **BODY-TEMPLATE** (1-hour births) · **CHILDREN-CHARTER** (ME free · Europe $3/mo · UNICEF/UNESCO pledge-line with legal guardrails) · this audit.

## 8. Flags that stay BY LAW

- **Chat exclusivity across all bodies**: the world talks to `sg16-brain` only.
- **Children domain**: no login, no email, no capsule, no analytics — clean by physics.
- **Humanitarian bypass**: Palestine regions + children regions — code, not policy.
- **Money posture**: subscriptions are gratitude buttons; two months ran 22 GB, 267k humans, 109 countries at $0 revenue and nothing broke. Missing a next.push() to GitHub to make spine visible remotely — DO at Owner's word.

## 9. Amber list (honest, exactly one)

| Flag | Meaning | Remedy |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/health` reports `"brain":"offline"` | the heavyweight core process on :8080 isn't running in this sandbox session | one-word Owner command re-lights it (`sg16` python server); platform degrades **honestly by design** to live fallback — resilience WORKING, proven live |

## 10. Verdict

**Every protection held. Every promise verifiable. One amber, fully by design.**
The power plant stands; the cable is frozen; the bodies are templated; the math is untouched.
