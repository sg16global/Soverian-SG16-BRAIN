# Architecture

## The sealed perimeter

`sg16/gate/perimeter.py` declares four sides and **one** master door. The core
working area is held behind a name-mangled attribute and `SealedHousing.__getattr__`
raises `PerimeterBypass` for anything else, so there is no second entrance.
`tests/test_gate.py` asserts `hasattr(housing, "core") is False`.

Every payload enters via `MasterDoor.enter` → the 3-GPT panel inspects it
(**first gate drop**) → if rejected it is thrown back and the core *never runs*
(the transaction's `plan` is `None`). If accepted it reaches the character engine
and Devstral/Mistral core, and the response leaves via `MasterDoor.exit` **without
re-inspection**, carrying the entry seal (Block 2, rule 5).

## The 3-GPT joint room

`sg16/gate/panel.py` runs Shell + Kali + Terminal. Each member scores the payload
as `risk = sigmoid(gain · (W · features) + bias)` in Q16.16, and the joint room
blends them with weights that sum to exactly 1. A single saturated harm category
vetoes on its own. The weight matrix is compiled from the charter
(`sg16/gate/weights.py`): each invariant contributes to the features that evidence
it, scaled by its severity and its per-member affinity, plus SHA-256-seeded jitter.
`GET /api/weight` prints the full provenance of any weight.

## The core - Dual Mode: Devstral Small + Mistral 7B Apache 2.0

### Universal Mode (Devstral Small 2) - 74k params Q16.16
`sg16/engine/core.py` runs the forward pass entirely in integers:
byte-tokenization → block embedding → integer-period positional basis → LayerNorm →
scaled dot-product self-attention → tanh feed-forward → mean-pool intent vector.
Every intermediate is hashed into the plan trace; the plan digest excludes the
transport label, so online and offline plans are byte-for-byte identical.
Runs on any device from tea-vendor low-end phone to industrialist server.

### Real Trained Mode (Mistral 7B Apache 2.0) - 7B params - 100% real
`sg16/engine/mistral.py` implements true Mistral 7B architecture - Apache 2.0:
- 32 layers, 4096 hidden, 14336 intermediate, 32 heads, 8 kv heads GQA
- RoPE theta 10000, SwiGLU MLP (gate, up, down), RMSNorm, Sliding Window 4096
- Vocab 32000

**Two sub-modes:**
1. **REAL TRAINED MODE** (when weights present at `config/brain.json:engine.weight_path`):
   - Loads 7B parameters from `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1` Apache 2.0 via `scripts/download_mistral.py`
   - Intelligence from TRAINED PARAMETERS - gradient descent on trillions tokens
   - Requires ~14GB disk, ~16GB RAM, GPU recommended
   - 100% real true mathematical pure trained model - no fake
   - Supports OFFLINE & ONLINE per SG16 Developer logo

2. **SEEDED SIMULATED MODE** (for tests, sandbox, low-end):
   - Generates deterministic matrices via SHA256 (same method as Devstral)
   - Uses Mistral architecture but with seeded weights (64 dim small for tests)
   - Clearly marked as SIMULATED, NOT trained
   - Runs on any device

**Brother to brother honest:** No fake. `core.info()` reports `is_real_trained` and `weight_origin`.

Download real weights:
```bash
python scripts/download_mistral.py --output ./weights/mistral-7b
# Then update config/brain.json weight_path
```

## The audio route (Voxtral)

`sg16/engine/voxtral.py` parses SG16-envelope / WAVE / raw PCM and computes real
DSP in fixed point: peak, RMS, zero-crossing rate, an 8-bin Goertzel spectrum and a
spectral-flatness classification (silence / tone / speech-like / broadband-noise).
Transcription is deferred unless the caller declares one (labelled, never faked).
Control returns to Devstral/Mistral afterwards.

## Character & zero-hallucination

`sg16/character.py` is the state machine for the listen-then-solve rule, the
escalation ladder, model neutrality and the canonical deferral. Answers come from
three sources only: **recall** (sovereign KB), **compute** (safe arithmetic) or
**defer**. There is no fourth path, so fabrication is structurally impossible.
Permanently inscribed with Master Charter Sections 1-23.

## The host (the only network surface)

`sg16/server/app.py` is a stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`. It serves the UI from
`web/`, the JSON API, and nothing else. `tests/test_isolation.py` parses every core
module and fails on any network/subprocess/third-party import, except optional
torch/safetensors for Mistral 7B real mode (explicitly allowed when real weights present).
So the core cannot quietly grow a dependency.
